The design of Xingkun Yin's implementation is chosen for the following reasons:
1. Hisimplementation has more design patterns that is more well use than the
other 2 implementations.
2. his implementation has more components and class that better define the 
seperation of responsibilities. The modular design makes it easier to modify
than the other 2 implementations

The decisions turn out to be benificial for out development of Legends of
Valor. We are able to finish the implementation in a short amount of time in
an elegent way.
